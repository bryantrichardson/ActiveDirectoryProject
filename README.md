# Phising Analysis

## Description
In this "project" I will be looking at three emails to determine if they are a phishing attempt or not. I will accomplish this by using an Ubuntu VM I configured and looking at the emails in Sublime Text. I will also be using open source sites such as VirusTotal, CyberChef, and whois.domaintools. I will document my analysis using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x6iyFD8RMnvcib08EjNJcqGKYUyPSI5aYdJ1Nq38E6g/edit">template.</a><br>

Below I will provide screenshots of the process I take to analyze each email. It will not be a complete step-by-step guide, but will cover the most important parts of the analysis. I will include links to each of the three templates at the very end in case you want to see the reports in their entirety.

Thanks for clicking on this/reading, hope the rest of your day/night is swell :).<br>

(For transparency, this Ubuntu setup and phishing challenge/analysis is apart of <a href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/security-operations-soc-101">TCM-Security SOC 101 course</a>. Only the first phishing analysis report is based on a challenge from the SOC101 course- the others are emails I have chosen from PhishTank.)
