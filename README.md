# Phising Analysis Using 

## Description
In this "project" I will be looking at three emails to determine if they are a phishing attempt or not. I will accomplish this by using an Ubuntu VM I configured and looking at the emails in Sublime Text. I will also be using open source sites such as VirusTotal, CyberChef, and _____. I will document my analysis using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x6iyFD8RMnvcib08EjNJcqGKYUyPSI5aYdJ1Nq38E6g/edit">template.</a><br>

Below I will provide screenshots of the process I take to analyze each email. It will not be a complete step-by-step guide, but will cover the most important parts of each. At the end, I will include links to each of the three reports using the before mentioned template. <br>

Thanks for clicking on this/reading, hope the rest of your day/night is swell :).
